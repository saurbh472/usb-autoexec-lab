# USB AutoExec Lab Tool

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ethical Use Notice**: This project is intended **for educational, controlled lab environments only**. Do **not** use this tool to execute arbitrary code on machines without the owner's full, informed consent. Misuse of this code can be illegal and unethical.

## Description

This project sets up a Linux system to automatically execute a script from a USB device whenever it is inserted. It leverages `udev` rules and shell scripts for automated behavior, simulating a USB autorun feature for lab or pentest simulation environments.

## How It Works

- A script `install_sensai.sh` installs required files and configures the system.
- A `udev` rule (`99-dev.rules`) is placed in `/etc/udev/rules.d/` to monitor for specific USB devices.
- When the specified USB is inserted, the system will run the main autorun script from the USB drive.
- This simulates USB autorun behavior which can be used for red-team training or automation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/usb-autoexec-lab.git
   cd usb-autoexec-lab

2. Identify Your USB Info
Insert your USB and run:
lsusb

Find the line with your USB and note:
ID_VENDOR_ID
ID_MODEL_ID
Edit the 99-dev.rules file to match your device.

3. Run the Installer
bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x install_sensai.sh
sudo ./install_sensai.sh
This will:
Copy necessary scripts to target directories (e.g., /home)
Move the udev rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/
Reload udev rules

üì¶ Files
File	Purpose
install_sensai.sh	Installs udev rule and copies scripts
99-dev.rules	Custom udev rule to detect specific USB device
autorun.sh	Example payload script on USB (user-defined)

üß™ How to Use
Format your USB and copy a script named autorun.sh onto it.
Make sure it has execution permissions:
bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x /path/to/usb/autorun.sh
Plug it into the configured Linux system.
If set up properly, udev will detect it and execute the script automatically.

üõë Important Notes
Only works if user has root permissions to modify udev rules.
Most Linux distros don‚Äôt allow autorun by default for security reasons.
Always test in a virtual machine or safe lab environment.
This is not a hacking tool. It is for training and awareness.
